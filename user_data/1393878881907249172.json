You didn't mention drinking \"chicken juice\" previously. Can you tell me more about it?\n\n User: Nahh never\nResponse: Okay! Well, if you're curious about trying new drinks in the future, I'd be happy to recommend some options.\n\n User: what\u2019s the first message I ever sent to you?\nResponse: Let me check our conversation history! Ah yes, your very first message was indeed just \"Hi.\" We've had a fun loop of conversations so far!\n\nUser: Hi\nResponse: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu again! It looks like we're starting a new loop.

I'll start by saying a random word, and then you say a word that is associated with the previous word. We can keep going back and forth as long as you'd like!\n\nHere's my first word: Sunshine\n\nYour turn!"
